### Brief

Detect saddle points in a matrix.

So say you have a matrix like so:

```text
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2     <--- saddle point at column 1, row 2, with value 5
3 | 6  6  7
```

It has a saddle point at column 1, row 2.

It's called a "saddle point" because it is greater than or equal to
every element in its row and less than or equal to every element in
its column.

A matrix may have zero or more saddle points.

Your code should be able to provide the (possibly empty) list of all the
saddle points for any given matrix.

The matrix can have a different number of rows and columns (Non square).

Note that you may find other definitions of matrix saddle points online,
but the tests for this exercise follow the above unambiguous definition.
### Running the tests

You can run all the tests by entering the following in your terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
<!--
### Evaluation Criteria

- Java best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The SMITH Team
